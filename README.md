Idea: an app that keeps track of all of your different shipments. Would link your amazon orders, and any other website you order from. 
Would have phone number for customer service of each app or website to get directly there. Would send notifications when item is shipped, when in transit, and when delivered. Possibly tailor it more to small business owners, so make it show the status of all their orders, let them check off when order was put together/packaged, and when mailed out. Could also message customers to check that they recieved the order and ask some questions. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
